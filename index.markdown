You can find links to my professional social media and resume on the my [main page][main-page].

- I write embedded code, mostly in C. I can also code in other languages.
- I lived most of my life in Brazil.
- I work for a start-up, [Artiphon][artiphon-page], that is changing the future of music creation. *Touch sound*
- I haven't always written code. I have worked in purchasing ([Webb][webb-page]), oil equipment manufacturing ([FMC Technologies][fmc-page]), and even drilling on an drilling rig ([Halliburton][halliburton-page]).
- I love music and play guitar and sing in my free time.

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

``` ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help]. -->
